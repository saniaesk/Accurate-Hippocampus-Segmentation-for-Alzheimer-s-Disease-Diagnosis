# Accurate-Hippocampus-Segmentation-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Diagnosis
For this experiment, we employed a publicly accessible dataset of brain MRI scans to train and assess our model's ability to accurately segment the hippocampus (https://zenodo.org/records/8055666). The collection is stored on Zenodo, a research data repository, and comprises more than 800 MRI scans of infants and young children, aged between 0 and 36 months. 
In addition to the MRI scans, the collection includes a reference atlas image called "t1_reference_subject_06mm.nii". This atlas image functions as a template or reference for accurately dividing the hippocampus in the MRI images. The atlas image has dimensions of 215 pixels in width, 234 pixels in height, and 42 pixels in depth. The initial two dimensions (215 and 234) denote the image's width and height, respectively, while the third dimension (42) signifies the total number of slices in the 3D volume. 
We have implemented the MRIDataset class, which effectively loads and pre-processes MRI data from the dataset using Python. 
In addition, we have utilized the MRIcron software, which is a highly valuable and frequently employed tool in the field of neuroimaging research. You can find more information about this software at the following link: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron 
MRIcron can open Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI-1) data format files, which are commonly used for archiving brain MRI scans in our area. MRIcron offers an intuitive interface for viewing and manipulating these cerebral scans in a three-dimensional environment. 
MRIcron has a crucial feature that allows users to define Regions of Interest (ROIs). 
ROIs enable researchers to concentrate on particular brain regions inside the MRI scan for subsequent investigation. MRIcron offers features for manually choosing or creating regions of interest (ROIs) according to the user's requirements.
After being defined, regions of interest (ROIs) can be stored in a Volume of Interest (VOI) format. This format can be further manipulated or transformed back into Nifti format to ensure interoperability with other neuroimaging software. Within the framework of our study, we established and supervised Regions of Interest (ROIs) utilizing MRIcron software. 

Ultimately, our code accomplishes the goal of precisely aligning and registering the atlas pictures (VOIs) with their matching MRI scans in the dataset. The purpose of registration is to align the reference atlas, which contains well-known anatomical landmarks, with the individual MRI scans in the dataset in a spatial manner. By utilizing the well-defined regions in the atlas, the model can enhance the precision of the segmentation process, namely in segmenting the hippocampus in the MRI images.
